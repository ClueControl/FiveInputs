# FiveInputs

Monitor 5 inputs.  Turn 5 outputs off/on as inputs change.  When all 5 inputs are on, turn on the master output.

If the DISABLE input is connected to ground, the game will not be active. When the DISABLE input is not connected to anything, the game will be active  

Monitor game 5 inputs, which need to be low when not solved and high when solved.  For each switch that is activated (high), the corresponding output will be turned on.  When all 5 inputs are activated, the master output will be turned on.
